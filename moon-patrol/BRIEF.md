# Brief: Moon Patrol (1983, DOS)

Irem's 1982 arcade original, DOS conversion. Nothing here has been read yet. This file is the triage, done on
2026-08-02 with `mzinfo.py` and `comrec.py` -- **every number below was
measured, not recalled** -- and the order the work is worth doing in.

## What triage found

- one `.COM`, 58,306 bytes -- the largest `.COM` in the collection
- rebuilds **byte-identically** on the first pass
- **0.5% decoded as code**: 139 instructions, 279 bytes

**0.5% is the whole story.** The other five games in this
collection decode between 45% and 90%. A recursive walk that reaches 279 bytes
of a 58 KB file has lost the thread almost immediately -- the entry does a
little and then transfers control somewhere the walk cannot follow.

Byte-identity here means nothing except that the bytes were copied. comrec
says so itself in its own report. Do not mistake it for progress.

The three things that produce this shape, in order of likelihood: the program
relocates itself to a fresh segment and jumps there (Zaxxon and ParaTrooper
both do, and comrec detects it from the entry stub -- it did not here); the
image is packed and unpacks itself at run time (`unpack.py` in the toolkit
knows several period packers); or control leaves through a table comrec cannot
see, which `--entries-from` exists for.

## Tested on 2026-08-02

`build.ps1` reports **BYTE-IDENTICAL**, `FF12627C…`. That is the floor and in
this case it means almost nothing else: 0.5% of the file came back as
instructions, so what was proved is that the bytes were copied.

## The first thing to do

Read the first thirty instructions of the entry and decide which of the three it is. Everything else waits on that. `tools/unpack.py` and `tools/triage.py` are the fast checks.

## How to regenerate

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Toolkit ..\..\DOS-Decompiler -Nasm C:\path\to\nasm.exe
```

Three steps: reconstruct, apply names, **reassemble and compare**. It refuses
to report success on anything short of an identical SHA-256. Put your own copy
of the game in `original\`; this repository ships none.

## The rules, and they do not bend

**Nothing derived from the game may ever be committed.** Not the binary, not a
byte-identical reconstruction of it, not extracted sprites, not memory dumps,
not screenshots. `original/`, `recovered/` and `reference/` are gitignored and
game binaries are blocked repository-wide as a backstop. A sprite sheet pulled
out of a copyrighted game is still that game, and a PNG does not feel like a
binary, which is exactly why people forget. Read what you staged before every
commit that adds files; never `git add -A`.

**Byte-identity is the floor, not the achievement.** Emitting the whole file as
`db` would also hash correctly and tell you nothing. The number that matters is
how much came back as instructions, and after that how much has a name with
evidence behind it.

**Measure, never recall.** Six times in this project the question "is it
finished?" found a real gap, and every time the previous count read 100%
against the wrong denominator: prologues instead of call targets, references
instead of bytes, direct calls instead of every address control reaches. Put
the denominator in the same sentence as the percentage. `annotate.py` checks
all of them on every build and prints them -- **read that output, not a
document's memory of it.**

**Every name carries its evidence.** A name with no `why` is a guess the next
reader will believe. This project has published three of those and withdrawn
them.

**Do not use heredocs to write scripts.** They eat backslash escapes and the
check then passes while measuring nothing.

**No absolute paths in repository code.** Take toolchains as parameters.

## The ladder, in order

1. `build.ps1` reports **BYTE-IDENTICAL**. Nothing counts before this.
2. The decode rate is as high as the file allows. A low one means control is
   leaving somewhere the walk cannot follow -- find out where before naming
   anything.
3. Every **call target** named, with evidence. Not every prologue: a
   hand-written runtime has none, and Karateka read "120 of 120" while 56 call
   targets had no name.
4. Every **tail-call entry** -- an address a `jmp` reaches from outside the
   routine containing it. Karateka had 39 of those while the direct-call count
   read 165 of 165.
5. Every **bracketed constant** named, or recorded in `_displacements` as an
   offset rather than an address.
6. **`_data_spans`**: a contiguous partition of the whole image, no gap and no
   overlap, each extent saying what it is for. This is the denominator that
   catches a symbol file which names every reference and has never looked at
   half the file.
7. Then the documents `01`-`06`, then the port.
