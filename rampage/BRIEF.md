# Brief: Rampage (1988, DOS)

Bally Midway's 1986 arcade original, DOS conversion by Activision. Nothing here has been read yet. This file is the triage, done on
2026-08-02 with `mzinfo.py` and `comrec.py` -- **every number below was
measured, not recalled** -- and the order the work is worth doing in.

## What triage found

- MZ, **0 relocations**, load image 0x200..0xE5FC (58,364 bytes)
- entry CS:IP `0E1F:0010` -- file offset 0xE400, at the very end
- seven data files: `Monsters.p4/.p16`, `Blocks.p4/.p16`, `Oshapes.p4`, `Title.p16`, `Rampage.bcc`

No relocations, so single-segment -- but the entry is at file
offset 0xE400, **twenty bytes from the end of a 58 KB image**. A program does
not begin at its own end unless the thing at the end is a stub that moves or
unpacks the rest and jumps into it.

The `.p4` and `.p16` suffixes are the giveaway for the data: 4-colour and
16-colour, so CGA and EGA versions of the same artwork. `Monsters.p4` at
23,072 bytes against `Monsters.p16` at 20,556 is the same content at two
depths.

The newest game in the collection by four years, and the only one from the
EGA era.

## Tested on 2026-08-02

`build.ps1` reports **BYTE-IDENTICAL**, `8925744E…`, at **34.7% decoded** —
the best of the four MZ files here, and it went through the `.COM` route
without complaint despite the entry sitting twenty bytes from the end.

## The first thing to do

Read the twenty bytes at the entry. They will say whether this unpacks, relocates, or simply starts oddly, and that decides everything after.

## How to regenerate

```powershell
.\build.ps1 -Toolkit ..\..\DOS-Decompiler -Nasm C:\path\to\nasm.exe
```

Three steps: reconstruct, apply names, **reassemble and compare**. It refuses
to report success on anything short of an identical SHA-256. Put your own copy
of the game in `original\`; this repository ships none.

## The rules, and they do not bend

**Nothing derived from the game may ever be committed.** Not the binary, not a
byte-identical reconstruction of it, not extracted sprites, not memory dumps,
not screenshots. `original/`, `recovered/` and `reference/` are gitignored and
game binaries are blocked repository-wide as a backstop. A sprite sheet pulled
out of a copyrighted game is still that game, and a PNG does not feel like a
binary, which is exactly why people forget. Read what you staged before every
commit that adds files; never `git add -A`.

**Byte-identity is the floor, not the achievement.** Emitting the whole file as
`db` would also hash correctly and tell you nothing. The number that matters is
how much came back as instructions, and after that how much has a name with
evidence behind it.

**Measure, never recall.** Six times in this project the question "is it
finished?" found a real gap, and every time the previous count read 100%
against the wrong denominator: prologues instead of call targets, references
instead of bytes, direct calls instead of every address control reaches. Put
the denominator in the same sentence as the percentage. `annotate.py` checks
all of them on every build and prints them -- **read that output, not a
document's memory of it.**

**Every name carries its evidence.** A name with no `why` is a guess the next
reader will believe. This project has published three of those and withdrawn
them.

**Do not use heredocs to write scripts.** They eat backslash escapes and the
check then passes while measuring nothing.

**No absolute paths in repository code.** Take toolchains as parameters.

## The ladder, in order

1. `build.ps1` reports **BYTE-IDENTICAL**. Nothing counts before this.
2. The decode rate is as high as the file allows. A low one means control is
   leaving somewhere the walk cannot follow -- find out where before naming
   anything.
3. Every **call target** named, with evidence. Not every prologue: a
   hand-written runtime has none, and Karateka read "120 of 120" while 56 call
   targets had no name.
4. Every **tail-call entry** -- an address a `jmp` reaches from outside the
   routine containing it. Karateka had 39 of those while the direct-call count
   read 165 of 165.
5. Every **bracketed constant** named, or recorded in `_displacements` as an
   offset rather than an address.
6. **`_data_spans`**: a contiguous partition of the whole image, no gap and no
   overlap, each extent saying what it is for. This is the denominator that
   catches a symbol file which names every reference and has never looked at
   half the file.
7. Then the documents `01`-`06`, then the port.
